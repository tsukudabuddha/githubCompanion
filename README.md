# Github Companion

This is currently an 'app' that takes in a user's github username and lets them know if they have made a commit or not today

## Future Goals
* Turn into full companion app
    * check commit history
    * browse Github
        * Users
        * Code
            * stretch goal of being able to download code to files app
    * Enable notifications
        * Send notification to user that they have committed already at set time
        * ... or that they have not made a commit yet and need to soon
